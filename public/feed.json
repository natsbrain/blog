Specially with start of AI boom and flood of new papers in this field, caught everyone by surprise, and it\u0026rsquo;s practically impossible to read each interesting new paper with the amount of time we have each day. So, there has been a new trend of starting new jounral clubs, specially in computer science \u0026amp; neuroscience, to help students and researchers to get a grasp of what\u0026rsquo;s happening so they don\u0026rsquo;t fall behind new works. I\u0026rsquo;ve been picking some tips on how to present a paper in journal clubs, and I\u0026rsquo;ve summerized them here. You can read the full sources, with links down below.",
